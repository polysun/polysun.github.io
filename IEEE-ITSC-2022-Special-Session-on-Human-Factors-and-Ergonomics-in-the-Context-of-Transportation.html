<h3><font color="#0000FF">Aim and Scope:</font></h3> 
<p>  

With the development of transportation tools and transportation networks toward higher intelligence, the drivers are gradually integrated into complex human-computer interaction systems. Human factors and ergonomics in the context of transportation adhere to driver-centered thinking and coordinate the development of transportation technology with the dynamics and complexity of the social, cognitive, and emotional processes in the traffic environment. </p><p>

From the driver's task operation level, human factors and ergonomics considers one task operation of the driver as several loops and in which one loop consists of the current driving state perception (visual, auditory, etc.), the activation of the brain area related to the task operation, the brain function connection, and the decision and execution of the task operation. From the larger transportation system level, to achieve an efficient and humanized intelligent transportation system, human factors and ergonomics should also consider the optimization of transportation networks with respect to the driver's mental workload and operational behavior, as well as the optimization of the organization and management of the transportation system with respect to the driver's physiology and psychology. </p>

<p>  
This special session aims to reveal the driver's neural ergonomics and cognition in the traffic context, as well as the cognitive traffic network that considers the driver's human factors. This special session encourages researchers to submit their valuable studies on human factors and ergonomics in the context of transportation, whether it is the research of the driver's physiological measurement, the driver's cognitive behavior, or the transportation system organization and management that takes human factors into consideration. Potential contributions may address, but are not limited to, the following topics:

<ul>
<li>Physiological measurement of the driver</li>
<li>State perception of the driver</li>
<li>Cognitive process modeling includes perception, memory, reasoning, and response</li>
<li>Activation of the brain area under task operation</li>
<li>Brain function connection under task operation</li>
<li>Decision and execution of the task operation</li>
<li>Human-computer interaction technology</li>
<li>Human reliability during driving</li>
<li>Physiological and psychological evaluation of the work stress</li>
<li>Transportation tool optimization concerning human factors and ergonomics</li>
<li>Transportation network optimization concerning human factors and ergonomics</li>
<li>Transportation system organization concerning human factors and ergonomics</li>
<li>Transportation system management concerning human factors and ergonomics</li>
<li>Application of artificial intelligence technology in human factors and ergonomics</li>
<li>Application of computational intelligence in human factors and ergonomics</li>
</ul>
